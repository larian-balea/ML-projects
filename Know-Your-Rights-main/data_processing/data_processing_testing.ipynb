    "* Chunks 2 and 3 are clearly **broken mid-sentence**, likely because the model misinterpreted legal references like \"art. 39 alin. (1)\" as semantic boundaries. These are **typical artifacts in legal texts**, which often use structured references that don't signal real content boundaries.\n",
